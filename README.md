## What I'm working on

Currently, I'm working on just zxtk, a ZX Spectrum emulator. I'm no-where near finished, but check it out at [link]https://github.com/icecream95/zxtk

Builds will appear here when it gets closer to being finished and Travis CL works properly

I'm also working on a C++ to Scratch ([link]https://scratch.mit.edu) compiler but it's still in the design stages so don't expect anything for a while.
