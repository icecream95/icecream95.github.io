# Icecream95
## What I'm working on

Currently, I'm working on a C++ to [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) [compiler](https://github.com/icecream95/scratch-llvm). I'm around the stage where you can compile basic programs.


I'm also working on zxtk, a ZX Spectrum emulator. I'm nowhere near finished, but check it out at [github.com/icecream95/zxtk](https://github.com/icecream95/zxtk).

~~Builds will appear here when it gets closer to being finished and Travis CI works properly~~

No builds will appear here as this emulator is designed to be modded, and until zxtk supports some form of interpereted scripting, I see no point in providing executables.

*(Note, if you really are that desperate, look at the zxtk-linux-\* branch of [this website](github.com/icecream95/icecream95.github.io) on github or [https://ci.appveyor.com/project/icecream95/zxtk/build/artifacts](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/icecream95/zxtk/build/artifacts). These executables are untested and probably won't work anyway)*

## My other accounts

I have a scratch account, so look at my projects [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Icecream95/).

I also have a Gitlab account [https://gitlab.com/icecream95](https://gitlab.com/icecream95) but I only use it for contributing 
to projects on Gitlab.
